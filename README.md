#### My main study vector is .NET web development 🌐. 

I study web development and databases at college and I have created a GitHub account to improve my skills. In my free time I enjoy experimenting with Arduino and ESP boards.

There you can find all my projects 🗃️, from simple practice work to more complex, meaningful ones that reflect my academic 👨‍🎓 and professional 👨‍🏭 history as well as my cognitive 🧠 development and presentation 🎑 skills.

In the future, I want to learn video and photo editing when I buy a new system and finally start using my student JetBrains license. I also want to learn more about Docker and Kubernetes in practice usage.

#### I have worked with:
  
**C and C++**, mainly in a more structured academic way, including STL, up to overloading virtual functions in child classes.

**C# with ASP.NET** (CRUD APIs) and Avalonia (MVVM user interfaces).

**Python** for study projects, where I focused on working with tables, building diagrams, and scraping websites.

**Ruby** and Ruby on Rails, although I did not enjoy this stack.
